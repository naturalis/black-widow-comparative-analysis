# black-widow-comparative-analysis
Comparative analysis and teaching materials on body mass dimorphism in black widows analyzed under phylogenetic independent contrasts.

The data folder contains a phylogenetic tree and a spreadsheet with trait measurements. Both are read by an RMarkdown document in the
src folder to reconcile the data (tip labels in tree with row labels in spreadsheet) and then analyzed under
[independent contrasts](https://rdrr.io/cran/ape/man/pic.html).
